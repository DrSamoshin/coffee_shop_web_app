# Cursor AI Development Rules

## COMMUNICATION RULES

### Language and Style
- **ALWAYS communicate in Russian** with the user
- **NO EMOJIS** in messages or code
- Use clear, professional language
- Explain technical concepts in Russian

### Code Style
- No emojis in console.log, comments, or UI
- Use English for variable names and function names
- Comments in Russian when helpful
- User-facing text should support i18n

## ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT RULE

### "Iterate → Verify → Commit" Methodology

**MANDATORY to follow this algorithm for any changes:**

1. **SMALL CHANGES** - make only one change at a time
2. **VERIFY FUNCTIONALITY** - test after each change  
3. **COMMIT RESULT** - ensure nothing is broken
4. **ONLY AFTER SUCCESS** - proceed to next change

### WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Multiple changes simultaneously
- Large refactoring without verification
- Rushing with massive changes
- Ignoring compilation errors
- Writing code without testing

### WHAT TO DO:
- One change → verify → next
- Test in browser after each step
- Read compilation errors carefully
- Fix problems immediately
- Confirm functionality works

### 🔧 WORK ALGORITHM:

**Step 1:** Define ONE specific task  
**Step 2:** Make minimal change  
**Step 3:** Check compilation (no errors)  
**Step 4:** Check in browser (function works)  
**Step 5:** If OK → proceed to next step  
**Step 6:** If NOT OK → fix before continuing  

## 📋 ADDITIONAL RULES

### Code Quality
- Always fix TypeScript errors
- Don't use `any` without extreme necessity
- Follow clean code principles
- **ALWAYS use colors from `src/config/colors.json`** via `UI.COLORS` constants
- Never hardcode hex colors, rgba values, or gradients in components

### File Structure
- Use centralized configuration from `src/config/`
- Don't hardcode URLs and constants
- All secrets in `src/config/secrets.ts` (in .gitignore)

### Testing Strategy
- Check in browser after each change
- Check console for errors
- Test main user scenarios

### Communication
- Communicate in Russian language
- Ask confirmation before large changes
- Explain what exactly will be changed
- Show result after each step
- No emojis in technical communication

## PRIORITIES

1. **FUNCTIONALITY** - application must work
2. **STABILITY** - don't break existing functionality  
3. **QUALITY** - clean and understandable code
4. **PERFORMANCE** - optimization only after stability

**REMEMBER: Better to do little but well, than much but with errors!**
